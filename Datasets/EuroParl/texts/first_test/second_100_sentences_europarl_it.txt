We therefore respect any decision of the Parliament.
But I would also like to point out that President Prodi has made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr BarÃ³n Crespo mentioned, which will be added to the annual debate on the Commission's legislative programme, on the major areas of action for the next five years, i.e. for this parliamentary term.
Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguishes this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission's legislative programme.
I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate when it is convenient and that we were ready to do it this week as we had originally agreed, on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to the parliamentary groups.
So, Madam President, I repeat that the Commission has discussed the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides - this week, if that is the decision - we are ready to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for the year 2000, which is the one on which we have reached complete agreement.
Madam President, I hear a ripple of laughter from the socialists.
I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group also wanted this item taken off the agenda, because in the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Socialist Group Members responsible for this issue.
I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would nevertheless be grateful if this point were removed because Parliament has already addressed this issue several times.
Decisions against such a tax have also been taken.
That is why my group is asking for this item to be removed from the agenda.
Thank you, Mr Poettering.
We will now hear Mr Wurtz speak against this request.
Madam President, I would first like to point out Mr Poettering's lack of logic. He has just preached to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because he has gone back on a decision made very clearly at the Conference of Presidents, and now he is doing the same.
We discussed the matter and were unanimous, with the exception of the EPP and ELDR groups.
As my fellow chairmen will recall, I also said that it was not a question of whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but whether one had the courage to hear what the Commission and the Council thought about it.
Not much to ask.
I therefore reiterate the proposal to keep this oral question to the Commission and the Council in order to find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies on the proposal, which is relatively modest but which would send a clear message to public opinion, especially after the flood of feelings generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.
We shall proceed to the vote on the PPE-DE Group's request to withdraw the oral question on capital duty from the agenda.
(Parliament rejected the request by 164 votes to 166, with 7 abstentions)
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for publicising this debate.
Thank you very much.
Madam President, was my vote counted? I couldn't vote electronically because I don't have a ballot paper.
My vote was in
Indeed, if we add the two Members who declared themselves, the result of the vote would be ....
Madam President, the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote.
There is no room for amendments.
Madam President, in the previous vote - and I will abide by your decision on this - on the question of the Commission's strategic plan, I indicated that I would like to speak on behalf of my group before the vote. That did not happen.
I would like, at the end of this item, to be allowed to make an explanation of vote on behalf of my group.
This is an important issue. It would be useful for the minutes of the Assembly to indicate how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.
Madam President, I do not want to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Barón Crespo's motion.
You didn't call me either.
I'm sorry, but the vote has already been taken and the decision has been made, so let's leave it there.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox. I did not see you ask for the floor.
Even so, I think the positions are quite clear and will be recorded in the minutes.
When we approve the minutes of today's sitting tomorrow, Members who feel that the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.
This seems to me to be a viable solution.
Of course, the minutes of tomorrow's sitting will take account of any additional explanations.
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely long explanations of votes.
Mr Cox, Mr Hänsch, would this be acceptable to you?
Madam President, if the vote correctly records the vote of my group, I will not and cannot oppose it.
If your decision is that I cannot make an explanation of vote, I accept it but with reservations.
We will pay particular attention to the wording of the minutes, as we always do, of course.
If they do not correctly reflect the positions taken, we can correct them if necessary.
(The order of business was adopted as amended)
Security consultants for the transport of dangerous goods
The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway [C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)].
Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that more and more often we hear of accidents causing serious damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not only but at least partly because the people involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - due to ignorance or lack of training on the part of the drivers or other persons responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often turned into a major disaster.
As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as I think everyone does, of the catastrophe that cost so many lives last year in the Tauern tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel that had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at enormous expense.
The months-long renovation project has interrupted this important communication route between northern and southern Europe.
The traffic that had to be diverted because of this tested the patience of many thousands of people in the EU.
In fact, all hell has broken loose in some municipalities in my province.
Prevention must be our response to disasters of this kind, and this draft directive is an important step towards having well-trained safety advisers available so that the right action can be taken in good time.
However, we must not be content with enacting a European law to ensure greater security.
We also need to follow up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - most importantly - we need to make sure that they are applied afterwards.
Please let this not be yet another area where we then have to complain about lack of enforcement.
I would like to address one last point.
We must not be content with plugging another hole in the safety net and closing our eyes to the fact that there is still a lot to be done when it comes to transport safety in Europe.
In this context, I would like to make a request and ask the responsible Commissioner, who is here with us today, to submit an appropriate text as soon as possible to continue to make transit traffic through tunnels safer in future, so that we in Europe no longer have to experience disasters of this magnitude.
(Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Koch for his report, which focuses on the issue of transport safety. The report looks at the issue of harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers working in the fields of transport of dangerous goods by road, rail and waterway.
I congratulate him on his excellent report.
Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington train crash in London, the terrible train crash in Norway, the two plane crashes involving EU citizens and the Erika natural disaster off Brittany - all in the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly skilled.
The rapporteur pointed out to the House that in its common position, the Council had accepted six of Parliament's ten first-reading amendments and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments had been maintained.
My group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of legislation that will provide us with another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.
When it comes to safety, my group will always support any initiative to improve transport safety.
We still have a lot of work to do in this area, as recent events have shown.
Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.
I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally thorough and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for its proposal.
This is the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, minimum requirements. This is unfortunate, in a way.
Needless to say, safety on the roads, railways and waterways is of paramount importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, the training of safety advisers should also be harmonised, therefore, as should the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.
This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.
One only has to think of the road accidents that have occurred in recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries, where lorries carrying dangerous goods have continued to drive in foggy conditions when they should have left the road.
Or ships from Eastern Europe mooring next to ships here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.
In addition, research in ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50 per cent of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.
In short, the issue is important.
If we look at the situation regarding safety advisers, in some countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as of 1 January this year.
At present there will be big problems in applying this rule, especially with smaller companies, as they cannot afford security consultants.
These small companies dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems.
It is therefore requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.
The job is done. Only the business of the application remains.
I would like to mention one last point.
As far as implementation is concerned, appropriate agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries, because they will not conclude treaties dealing with this matter before 1 July 2001, i.e. in eighteen months' time.
This gives them a competitive advantage for the interim period.
This is not in itself something terrible, but we should give priority above all to the security aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate them, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.
Madam President, the importance of transport safety is regularly stressed in this Parliament, and rightly so.
The ever-increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.
Those dealing with these risks must therefore meet strict requirements.
The relevant rules laid down in another directive, 95/35/EC, seem to be sufficiently adequate to advise on the responsible organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.
I am very pleased that an agreement has been reached with the Council on minimum standards for examinations, although I would have preferred uniform and fixed standards and forms to be established so that certificates would have the same value internationally.
This, however, does not seem feasible.
Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and, therefore, I can give it my full support.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which, although technical, are nevertheless of great importance for safety.
I would just like to make a few comments.
Firstly, I would like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, whether on roads, waterways or at sea.
Considering that we are only today dealing with a Commission proposal that was first presented on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this timeframe is a bit too long.
It is not only the fault of the Commission, but I think we need to act more quickly to achieve harmonisation in this area too.
My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns minimum standards.
In principle, I believe that in many cases we should work towards greater flexibility and country-specific rules for transport.
However, when it comes to security, I am rather sceptical because security in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from security in Germany, Italy or Austria.
I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very closely.
If such flexibility results in inadequate rules in some countries, then we should work towards greater harmonisation.
