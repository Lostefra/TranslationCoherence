I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.
Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded millennium bug failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.
In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute's silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.
Please rise, then, for this minute's silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)

You have asked for a debate on this subject over the next few days, during this session.
In the meantime, I would like to observe a minute's silence, as requested by some Members, on behalf of all the victims, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.
I would therefore ask you to rise for this minute's silence.

These sets of differences are not disjoint: for example in the section "riformulazioni" it's possibile to find wide portions of text different from the two version, that contain inside different versions of single words (or sub-portions) like verbs, nouns, etc.

Notes:
1) The label "captured/not captured" indicates if the semantic difference is captured in the ontology

Differences (EN | EN -> IT -> EN) in text:
	1) verbi: tempi verbali e sinonimi:
		- resumed | that I am resuming (not captured)
		- adjourned on | which was interrupted on (captured)
		- enjoyed | have had (captured)
		- failed to materialise | has not materialised (captured)
		- requested | asked for (captured)
		- should | would (still to verify)
		- have requested | requested by (still to verify)

	2) nomi
		- people | populations (captured)

	3) aggettivi
		- dreadful | appalling (captured)

	4) preprosizioni:
		
	5) riformulazioni:
		- still the people in a number of countries | the populations of some countries have nevertheless (captured but challenging)
		- natural disasters that truly were dreadful | truly appalling natural disasters (captured but challenging)
		- in the course of | over (captured by a predicate name)
		- as a number of Members have requested | as requested by some Members (still to verify)
		- Please rise, then, | I would therefore ask you to rise (still to verify)

	6) perdite:

Notes:
1) Syntactic differences are due to Fred and not necessarily expres semantic differences.
2) The numbered differences correspond to real differences in the text

Qualitative analysis:
1) sentences semantically identical (even if not really different syntactically) can generate quite or even very different graphs
2) be careful with predicates' name: sometimes in really similar situation, it's possible to find different predicates
3) don't rely on objects' names: different object's name in the 2 ontologies can refers to the same object
(as in the ontology of the first sentence)
4) sometimes in one of the two ontologies there are more triples respect to the other one, that do not add semantics
(often with articles, see quant:hasDeterminer predicate, but also some exceeding situations)

    => We need to discriminate differences generated bu Fred (syntactic differences in the graph)
       from the ones generated by the translation process.

Some strategies:
1) about synonyms differences: if you are lucky the two synonyms in the 2 versions have the same neighbours in the graph
2) about reformulations differences: if you are lucky (like for "inCourseOf/over", Â¿maybe it happens with short expressions?) the 2 expressions are used to name the same predicate
that connects the same objects
