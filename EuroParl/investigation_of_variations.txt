I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.
Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.
In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute's silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.
Please rise, then, for this minute's silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)

I declare that I am resuming the session of the European Parliament, which was interrupted on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a Happy New Year in the hope that you have had a pleasant festive period.
Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded millennium bug has not materialised, the populations of some countries have nevertheless suffered a series of truly appalling natural disasters.
You have asked for a debate on this subject over the next few days, during this session.
In the meantime, I would like to observe a minute's silence, as requested by some Members, on behalf of all the victims, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.
I would therefore ask you to rise for this minute's silence.
